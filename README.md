## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. There are many benefits to using a version control system, one of the most important
    being that it allows team members to open and edit files simultaneously without any
    worries of overwrites.
2. The basic Git commands can be compared to going grocery shopping: git add is adding
    items to your cart, git commit is purchasing them, git push is using and placing
    those items in your home.
3. A distributed version control system seems to be the safest, most logical version
    control system to use. The major downsides to centralized and local version control
    systems is that it is easy for all the files to be completely lost in the event of
    a crisis such as a server going down or being corrupted.
